Fun Calculator üéâ
A simple and cheerful Python calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers with style!
What It Does
This calculator takes two numbers from the user and performs all four basic mathematical operations:

Addition ‚ûï - Adds the two numbers together
Subtraction ‚ûñ - Subtracts the second number from the first
Multiplication ‚úñÔ∏è - Multiplies the two numbers
Division ‚ûó - Divides the first number by the second

Features

Decimal Support: Uses float() to handle both whole numbers and decimals
User-Friendly: Clear prompts and formatted output
Comprehensive: Shows all four operations at once
Fun Interface: Includes emojis and encouraging comments

How to Use

Run the program:
bashpython fun_calculator.py

Enter your numbers:

When prompted, enter your first number
Then enter your second number
Both can be whole numbers or decimals


View results:

The program will display all four mathematical operations
Results are clearly labeled and easy to read



Example Usage
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2.5

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 13.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 26.25
Quotient: 4.2
Requirements

Python 3.x
No external libraries required - uses only built-in Python functions

Important Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è Division by Zero: The current version doesn't handle division by zero. Make sure not to enter 0 as the second number, or you'll get a runtime error.
Future Improvements

Add error handling for division by zero
Include input validation to ensure users enter valid numbers
Add more mathematical operations (exponents, square roots, etc.)
Create a menu system for repeated calculations

Installation
No installation required! Just save the code as a .py file and run it with Python.

Have fun calculating! üßÆ‚ú®
